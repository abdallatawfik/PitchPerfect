#  Pitch Perfect


![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-iOS-blue.svg)

An iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. All audio records are stored using CoreData to be played later.

This is an advanced version of the Pitch Perfect project and was developed as a part of [Udacity](https://eg.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003) [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://eg.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).
